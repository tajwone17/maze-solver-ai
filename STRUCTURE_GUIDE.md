# 📁 Maze Solver - Complete Code Guide

## 🎯 Overview

The maze solver has been refactored from a single 291-line file into a clean, modular structure with **6 focused files**. This makes the code much easier to understand, maintain, and extend. Each file has a specific responsibility and is well-documented.

## 🔄 What Changed? (Before vs After)

### **Before** (Single File - Hard to Understand)

```
script.js (291 lines)
├── MazeSolver class with everything mixed together
├── DOM manipulation scattered throughout
├── Maze generation mixed with solving logic
├── DFS algorithm hidden in UI code
├── Settings spread across the file
└── Hard to extend or modify
```

### **After** (Modular Structure - Easy to Understand)

```
6 separate, focused files:
├── config.js (60 lines) - All settings in one place
├── maze-generator.js (120 lines) - Pure maze creation logic
├── dfs-solver.js (150 lines) - Pure pathfinding algorithm
├── ui-controller.js (180 lines) - Pure DOM/visual management
├── main.js (150 lines) - Application coordination
└── app.js (30 lines) - Simple entry point
```

## 🎯 Key Benefits of New Structure

✅ **Easier to Learn**: Each file focuses on one concept  
✅ **Easier to Debug**: Problems are isolated to specific files  
✅ **Easier to Extend**: Add new features without breaking existing code  
✅ **Easier to Understand**: Clear separation of responsibilities  
✅ **Better Documentation**: Each file is thoroughly commented

## 📂 File Structure & Responsibilities

```
maze-solver-ai/
├── index.html          # HTML structure and UI layout
├── styles.css          # All CSS styling and animations
├── app.js             # Application entry point (initializes everything)
├── main.js            # Main application controller (orchestrates components)

## 🔍 Detailed File Explanations

### 1. **config.js** - Configuration Hub

**Purpose**: Contains all constants, settings, and configuration in one place.

**What it includes**:

- Maze dimensions (rows, cols, cell size)
- Start and end positions
- Cell types (wall=0, path=1)
- CSS class names
- Animation timing
- Movement directions
- DOM element IDs
- Status messages

**Why it's helpful**: Easy to modify settings without hunting through multiple files.

```javascript
// Example: Change maze size easily
export const MAZE_CONFIG = {
  ROWS: 21, // Change this to make maze bigger/smaller
  COLS: 31, // Change this to make maze wider/narrower
  CELL_SIZE: 25, // Change cell visual size
};
```

### 2. **maze-generator.js** - Maze Creation Logic

**Purpose**: Handles all maze generation using recursive backtracking algorithm.

**Key methods**:

- `generateMaze()` - Main entry point for maze generation
- `initializeMaze()` - Creates initial grid of walls
- `getUnvisitedNeighbors()` - Finds valid neighbors during generation
- `carvePassage()` - Removes walls between cells
- `isValidCell()` - Boundary checking

**Algorithm explanation**:

1. Start with all walls
2. Pick a random starting cell
3. Randomly choose unvisited neighbors
4. Carve passages between cells
5. Backtrack when no unvisited neighbors
6. Continue until all reachable cells are visited

### 3. **dfs-solver.js** - Pathfinding Algorithm

**Purpose**: Implements the Depth-First Search algorithm to solve mazes.

**Key methods**:

- `solveMaze()` - Main entry point for solving
- `dfs()` - Recursive DFS implementation
- `isValidPosition()` - Checks if a move is valid
- `highlightSolutionPath()` - Animates the final solution
- `isStartCell()` / `isEndCell()` - Position checking utilities

**Algorithm steps**:

1. Start at the green cell (start position)
2. Try moving in all four directions (up, down, left, right)
3. Mark visited cells to avoid cycles
4. If reaching a dead end, backtrack
5. Continue until reaching the red cell (end position)
6. Return the path if found

### 4. **ui-controller.js** - Visual Interface Manager

**Purpose**: Handles all DOM manipulation and visual updates.

**Key methods**:

- `renderMaze()` - Creates the visual grid of cells
- `createCell()` - Creates individual cell elements
- `updateCellVisual()` - Updates cell appearance during solving
- `clearPathVisuals()` - Removes solution highlighting
- `updateButtonStates()` - Manages button enable/disable states
- `setupEventListeners()` - Connects buttons to functions

**Visual states managed**:

- Walls (dark blue)
- Paths (light gray)
- Start cell (green with pulse animation)
- End cell (red with pulse animation)
- Visited cells (orange)
- Current cell (blue with glow)
- Solution path (purple)

### 5. **main.js** - Application Controller

**Purpose**: Orchestrates all components and manages application state.

**Key responsibilities**:

- Creates instances of all other classes
- Manages application state (solving, solved, mazeExists)
- Coordinates between maze generation, solving, and UI updates
- Handles user interactions
- Provides error handling

**State management**:

```javascript
this.state = {
  solving: false, // Currently running DFS?
  solved: false, // Solution found and displayed?
  mazeExists: false, // Valid maze generated?
};
```

### 6. **app.js** - Entry Point

**Purpose**: Simple entry point that initializes the application when the page loads.

**What it does**:

- Waits for DOM to load
- Creates the main MazeApp instance
- Sets up global error handling
- Makes the app accessible for debugging

## 🧩 How Components Work Together

```
User clicks "Generate Maze"
        ↓
app.js → main.js → maze-generator.js (creates 2D array)
        ↓
main.js → ui-controller.js (renders visually)
        ↓
User sees new maze, clicks "Solve"
        ↓
main.js → dfs-solver.js (starts recursive search)
        ↓
For each step: dfs-solver.js → ui-controller.js (visual update)
        ↓
Solution found → highlight path → update status
```

## 🔧 How to Modify/Extend

### **Add a new pathfinding algorithm**:

1. Create `bfs-solver.js` similar to `dfs-solver.js`
2. Implement the BFS algorithm
3. Add button in HTML
4. Add case in main.js to use new solver

2. Implement the algorithm following same interface
3. Update main.js to use new generator

### **Change maze size**:

- Adjust CSS cell sizes if needed

## 🐛 Debugging Tips

### **Console debugging**:

```javascript
// App is globally accessible
window.mazeApp.getStatistics(); // Get current state
window.mazeApp.getCurrentMaze(); // See maze array
window.mazeApp.getSolutionPath(); // See solution
```

### **Visual debugging**:

- Each cell has ID `cell-${row}-${col}`
- Use browser dev tools to inspect cell states
- Console logs show algorithm progress

### **Common issues**:

- **No solution found**: Check if start/end are accessible paths
- **Slow animation**: Adjust `ANIMATION` values in config.js
- **Visual glitches**: Check CSS class conflicts
