## Introduction and Overview

The Super Simple Maze Solver demonstrates several important programming concepts:

- **Maze generation** using recursive backtracking
- **Pathfinding** with Depth-First Search (DFS)
- **Game mechanics** for the player vs. computer race mode
- **User interface** for displaying and interacting with the maze

Each section below breaks down the important functions and explains them in simple terms.

## Core Concepts

Before diving into the functions, let's understand some core concepts used throughout the code:

### The Maze Data Structure

The maze is stored as a 2D array (a grid) where:

- `0` (WALL) represents walls that you can't move through
- `1` (PATH) represents pathways that you can move through

```javascript
// Example of a tiny 5x5 maze
maze = [
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], // All walls on top row
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], // Some paths in this row
  [0, 1, 1, 1, 0], // More paths here
  [0, 1, 0, 1, 0], // Some more paths
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], // All walls on bottom row
];
```

### Coordinates

Positions in the maze are represented as rows and columns:

- `row` represents the vertical position (top to bottom)
- `col` represents the horizontal position (left to right)

```javascript
// Example: this refers to the position at row 2, column 3
maze[2][3];
```

## Maze Generation Functions

### `generateNewMaze()`

**What it does:** Creates a new random maze from scratch.

**Step by step:**

1. Resets all the game state variables
2. Creates an empty grid filled with walls using `initializeEmptyMaze()`
3. Carves paths through the maze using `carvePathsThroughMaze()`
4. Makes sure the start and end points are open paths
5. Displays the maze on the screen
6. Updates the status message and button states

**When it's used:** When the page loads and when you click "Generate New Maze" or "Reset"

```javascript
function generateNewMaze() {
  // Reset variables
  isSolving = false;
  isSolved = false;
  doesMazeExist = false;
  solutionPath = [];

  // Create the maze
  initializeEmptyMaze();
  carvePathsThroughMaze();

  // Make sure start and end are paths
  maze[START_ROW][START_COL] = PATH;
  maze[END_ROW][END_COL] = PATH;

  // Show the maze and update UI
  displayMaze();
  doesMazeExist = true;
  updateStatus("Maze generated! Click 'Solve Maze' to find the path.");
  updateButtonStates();
}
```

### `initializeEmptyMaze()`

**What it does:** Creates a grid filled entirely with walls.

**Step by step:**

1. Sets `maze` to be an empty array
2. Creates a row for each position from 0 to `MAZE_ROWS-1`
3. For each row, creates a column from 0 to `MAZE_COLS-1`
4. Fills each cell with the value `WALL` (which is 0)

**When it's used:** At the beginning of maze generation

```javascript
function initializeEmptyMaze() {
  maze = [];

  // Create a grid filled with walls (0)
  for (let row = 0; row < MAZE_ROWS; row++) {
    maze[row] = [];
    for (let col = 0; col < MAZE_COLS; col++) {
      maze[row][col] = WALL;
    }
  }
}
```

### `carvePathsThroughMaze()`

**What it does:** Creates pathways through the maze by removing walls.

**Step by step:**

1. Creates a stack (an array that keeps track of our path)
2. Starts at position (1,1) and marks it as a path
3. Enters a loop that continues until all cells are processed:
   - Checks for unvisited neighboring cells
   - If it finds any, randomly picks one
   - Removes the wall between the current cell and the chosen neighbor
   - Marks the neighbor as a path and adds it to the stack
   - If there are no unvisited neighbors, removes the current cell from the stack (backtracking)

**How it works:** This uses a technique called "recursive backtracking" which is like exploring a labyrinth with a ball of string:

- Go in a random direction until you hit a dead end
- When you hit a dead end, backtrack until you find a new path to explore
- Keep doing this until you've explored every possible path

**When it's used:** After initializing the empty maze

```javascript
function carvePathsThroughMaze() {
  const stack = [];
  let startCell = { row: 1, col: 1 };

  maze[startCell.row][startCell.col] = PATH;
  stack.push(startCell);

  while (stack.length > 0) {
    const currentCell = stack[stack.length - 1];
    const neighbors = getUnvisitedNeighbors(currentCell.row, currentCell.col);

    if (neighbors.length > 0) {
      // Choose random neighbor
      const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * neighbors.length);
      const nextCell = neighbors[randomIndex];

      // Remove wall between cells
      const wallRow = currentCell.row + (nextCell.row - currentCell.row) / 2;
      const wallCol = currentCell.col + (nextCell.col - currentCell.col) / 2;
      maze[wallRow][wallCol] = PATH;

      // Mark neighbor as path and add to stack
      maze[nextCell.row][nextCell.col] = PATH;
      stack.push(nextCell);
    } else {
      // No unvisited neighbors, backtrack
      stack.pop();
    }
  }
}
```

### `getUnvisitedNeighbors(row, col)`

**What it does:** Finds all neighboring cells that haven't been visited yet.

**Step by step:**

1. Creates an empty list for valid neighbors
2. Checks in all four directions (up, down, left, right)
3. For each direction, looks at cells 2 steps away (this skips over the wall between cells)
4. If a neighbor is valid and still a wall (meaning it hasn't been visited), adds it to the list
5. Returns the list of valid neighbors

**When it's used:** During maze generation to find which cells can be connected next

```javascript
function getUnvisitedNeighbors(row, col) {
  const neighbors = [];
  const directions = [
    [-2, 0], // Up
    [2, 0], // Down
    [0, -2], // Left
    [0, 2], // Right
  ];

  for (let i = 0; i < directions.length; i++) {
    const newRow = row + directions[i][0];
    const newCol = col + directions[i][1];

    if (isValidCell(newRow, newCol) && maze[newRow][newCol] === WALL) {
      neighbors.push({ row: newRow, col: newCol });
    }
  }

  return neighbors;
}
```

### `isValidCell(row, col)`

**What it does:** Checks if a cell position is valid for maze generation.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if the row is greater than 0 and less than `MAZE_ROWS-1`
2. Checks if the column is greater than 0 and less than `MAZE_COLS-1`

**Why this matters:** This ensures we stay within the maze boundaries and keep a wall around the outer edge of the maze.

**When it's used:** During maze generation to check if neighboring cells are valid

```javascript
function isValidCell(row, col) {
  return row > 0 && row < MAZE_ROWS - 1 && col > 0 && col < MAZE_COLS - 1;
}
```

## Maze Solving Functions

### `solveMaze()`

**What it does:** Starts the process of finding a path through the maze.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if conditions are right for solving (maze exists and isn't already being solved)
2. Updates the status message and button states
3. Clears any previous solution visualization
4. Calls `startSolving()` to begin the actual solving process

**When it's used:** When you click the "Solve Maze" button

```javascript
function solveMaze() {
  if (!doesMazeExist || isSolving || isSolved) {
    return;
  }

  isSolving = true;
  updateStatus("Solving maze using Depth-First Search...");
  updateButtonStates();

  clearVisualization();
  startSolving();
}
```

### `startSolving()`

**What it does:** Manages the maze-solving process and handles the outcome.

**Step by step:**

1. Creates a Set to track visited cells and an array for the path
2. Calls `depthFirstSearch()` starting from the beginning position
3. If a solution is found:
   - Saves the path
   - Sets the maze as solved
   - Shows the solution path with `highlightSolution()`
   - Updates the status message
4. If no solution is found, shows an error message
5. Always updates the state variables when finished

**When it's used:** After `solveMaze()` to handle the solving process

```javascript
async function startSolving() {
  try {
    const visited = new Set();
    const path = [];

    const found = await depthFirstSearch(START_ROW, START_COL, visited, path);

    if (found) {
      // Solution found!
      solutionPath = path;
      isSolved = true;
      await highlightSolution();
      updateStatus(`Maze solved! Path found with ${path.length} steps.`);
    } else {
      // No solution found
      updateStatus("No solution found! The maze might be unsolvable.");
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error solving maze:", error);
    updateStatus("An error occurred while solving the maze.");
  } finally {
    isSolving = false;
    updateButtonStates();
  }
}
```

### `depthFirstSearch(row, col, visited, path)`

**What it does:** Finds a path through the maze using the Depth-First Search algorithm.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if the current position is the end point
   - If it is, adds it to the path and returns true (solution found!)
2. Checks if the current position is valid (not a wall, not already visited, within bounds)
   - If it's not valid, returns false (can't go this way)
3. Marks the current cell as visited and adds it to the path
4. Visualizes the current cell for animation
5. Tries each of the four directions (up, down, left, right):
   - For each direction, recursively calls itself to explore that way
   - If any direction leads to a solution, returns true
6. If no direction leads to a solution, removes the current cell from the path (backtracking) and returns false

**How it works:** Imagine you're in a maze with a piece of chalk:

- At each intersection, mark where you've been
- Try one path at a time, going as deep as you can
- If you hit a dead end, go back to the last intersection and try a different direction
- Keep doing this until you either find the exit or try all possible paths

**When it's used:** During the maze-solving process to find a path from start to end

```javascript
async function depthFirstSearch(row, col, visited, path) {
  // Check if reached the end
  if (row === END_ROW && col === END_COL) {
    path.push({ row, col });
    return true;
  }

  // Check if valid move
  if (!isValidMove(row, col, visited)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Mark as visited and add to path
  const cellKey = `${row},${col}`;
  visited.add(cellKey);
  path.push({ row, col });

  // Visualize exploration
  await updateCellVisual(row, col, "current");
  await sleep(SOLVING_SPEED);

  // Mark as visited (except start/end)
  if (
    (row !== START_ROW || col !== START_COL) &&
    (row !== END_ROW || col !== END_COL)
  ) {
    await updateCellVisual(row, col, "visited");
  }

  // Try all four directions
  const directions = [
    [-1, 0], // Up
    [1, 0], // Down
    [0, -1], // Left
    [0, 1], // Right
  ];

  for (let i = 0; i < directions.length; i++) {
    const newRow = row + directions[i][0];
    const newCol = col + directions[i][1];

    if (await depthFirstSearch(newRow, newCol, visited, path)) {
      return true; // Found solution in this direction!
    }
  }

  // No solution found in any direction, backtrack
  path.pop();
  return false;
}
```

### `isValidMove(row, col, visited)`

**What it does:** Checks if a position is valid to move to during pathfinding.

**Step by step:**

1. Creates a unique key for the cell position
2. Checks if the row and column are within the maze boundaries
3. Checks if the cell is a path (not a wall)
4. Checks if the cell hasn't been visited before

**When it's used:** During the DFS algorithm to decide which cells can be explored

```javascript
function isValidMove(row, col, visited) {
  const cellKey = `${row},${col}`;

  return (
    row >= 0 &&
    row < MAZE_ROWS && // Within vertical bounds
    col >= 0 &&
    col < MAZE_COLS && // Within horizontal bounds
    maze[row][col] === PATH && // Is a path (not a wall)
    !visited.has(cellKey) // Not already visited
  );
}
```

### `highlightSolution()`

**What it does:** Animates the solution path after the maze has been solved.

**Step by step:**

1. Goes through each cell in the solution path
2. For each cell (except start and end cells), updates its appearance to show it's part of the solution
3. Adds a delay between cells to create an animation effect

**When it's used:** After finding a solution to show the path from start to end

```javascript
async function highlightSolution() {
  for (let i = 0; i < solutionPath.length; i++) {
    const cell = solutionPath[i];

    // Skip start and end cells
    if (
      (cell.row === START_ROW && cell.col === START_COL) ||
      (cell.row === END_ROW && cell.col === END_COL)
    ) {
      continue;
    }

    await updateCellVisual(cell.row, cell.col, "solution");
    await sleep(SOLUTION_SPEED);
  }
}
```

### `clearPath()`

**What it does:** Removes the solution path visualization.

**Step by step:**

1. Calls `clearVisualization()` to remove all visual markers
2. Resets solution-related variables
3. Updates the status message and button states

**When it's used:** When you click "Clear Path"

```javascript
function clearPath() {
  clearVisualization();
  isSolved = false;
  solutionPath = [];

  updateStatus("Path cleared. Click 'Solve Maze' to find the path again.");
  updateButtonStates();
}
```

## Race Mode Functions

### `startRace()`

**What it does:** Begins a race between the player and the computer.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if a maze exists and there's not already a race active
2. Resets the race state (positions, winner)
3. Clears any visualizations from prior solving
4. Calls `findComputerPath()` to determine how the computer will navigate
5. Updates the UI and disables buttons
6. Displays the player and computer starting positions
7. Starts the countdown animation

**When it's used:** When you click the "Start Race!" button

```javascript
function startRace() {
  if (!doesMazeExist || raceActive) {
    return;
  }

  // Reset race state
  winner = null;
  userPosition = { row: START_ROW, col: START_COL };
  computerPosition = { row: START_ROW, col: START_COL };
  clearVisualization();

  // Find computer's path
  findComputerPath();

  // Update UI
  updateStatus("Get ready...");
  updateButtonStates(true);
  displayMaze();
  showPlayers();

  // Start countdown
  startCountdown();
}
```

### `startCountdown()`

**What it does:** Shows a countdown (3...2...1...GO!) before the race begins.

**Step by step:**

1. Displays "3..." and waits 1 second
2. Displays "2..." and waits 1 second
3. Displays "1..." and waits 1 second
4. Displays "GO!" and waits 0.5 seconds
5. Sets `raceActive` to true
6. Updates the status message
7. Calls `startComputerMovement()` to begin computer's movement

**When it's used:** At the beginning of a race

```javascript
async function startCountdown() {
  await sleep(500);
  updateStatus("3...");
  await sleep(1000);
  updateStatus("2...");
  await sleep(1000);
  updateStatus("1...");
  await sleep(1000);
  updateStatus("GO!");
  await sleep(500);

  // Start the race
  raceActive = true;
  updateStatus("Race started! Use arrow keys or WASD to move.");
  updateButtonStates();

  // Start computer movement
  startComputerMovement();
}
```

### `findComputerPath()`

**What it does:** Calculates the path the computer will follow during the race.

**Step by step:**

1. Creates a Set to track visited cells
2. Creates an empty array for the computer's path
3. Calls `findPath()` to find a path from start to end
4. The path is stored in `computerPath` for use during the race

**When it's used:** Before starting a race to determine the computer's route

```javascript
async function findComputerPath() {
  const visited = new Set();
  computerPath = [];

  // Find a path from start to end
  await findPath(START_ROW, START_COL, visited, computerPath);
}
```

### `findPath(row, col, visited, path)`

**What it does:** A simplified version of DFS to find a path for the computer.

**Step by step:**
Similar to `depthFirstSearch()` but without visualization:

1. Checks if at the end point
2. Checks if the position is valid
3. Marks the cell as visited and adds to path
4. Tries all four directions
5. Backtracks if no path is found

**When it's used:** Before a race to find the computer's path

```javascript
async function findPath(row, col, visited, path) {
  // Check if reached the end
  if (row === END_ROW && col === END_COL) {
    path.push({ row, col });
    return true;
  }

  // Check if position is valid
  const cellKey = `${row},${col}`;
  if (!isValidMove(row, col, visited)) {
    return false;
  }

  // Mark as visited and add to path
  visited.add(cellKey);
  path.push({ row, col });

  // Try all four directions
  const directions = [
    [-1, 0], // Up
    [1, 0], // Down
    [0, -1], // Left
    [0, 1], // Right
  ];

  for (let i = 0; i < directions.length; i++) {
    const newRow = row + directions[i][0];
    const newCol = col + directions[i][1];

    if (await findPath(newRow, newCol, visited, path)) {
      return true; // Found a path!
    }
  }

  // No path found, backtrack
  path.pop();
  return false;
}
```

### `startComputerMovement()`

**What it does:** Controls the computer's movement during the race.

**Step by step:**

1. Sets up a timer that runs at regular intervals
2. Each time the timer runs:
   - Moves the computer to the next position in its pre-calculated path
   - Updates the display to show the new position
   - Checks if the computer has won
3. Stops the timer when the computer reaches the end

**When it's used:** During a race to animate the computer's movement

```javascript
function startComputerMovement() {
  let moveIndex = 1; // Start from second position (after start)

  // Set up timer for movement
  computerMoveInterval = setInterval(() => {
    if (moveIndex < computerPath.length) {
      // Move to next position
      computerPosition = computerPath[moveIndex];
      moveIndex++;

      // Update display and check for win
      showPlayers();
      checkWinCondition();
    } else {
      // Reached end of path
      clearInterval(computerMoveInterval);
    }
  }, COMPUTER_MOVE_SPEED);
}
```

### `handleKeyPress(event)`

**What it does:** Processes keyboard input for player movement.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if a race is active
2. If the restart key (R) is pressed, resets the race
3. Otherwise, determines which direction key was pressed (arrows or WASD)
4. Updates the player's position based on the key
5. Checks if the move is valid
6. If not valid, reverts to the previous position
7. Updates the display and checks if the player has won

**When it's used:** During a race when the player presses a key

```javascript
function handleKeyPress(event) {
  if (!raceActive) {
    return;
  }

  // Check for restart key
  if (RESTART_KEYS.includes(event.code)) {
    resetRace();
    return;
  }

  // Store current position
  const oldRow = userPosition.row;
  const oldCol = userPosition.col;

  // Check which key was pressed
  if (UP_KEYS.includes(event.code)) {
    userPosition.row--;
  } else if (DOWN_KEYS.includes(event.code)) {
    userPosition.row++;
  } else if (LEFT_KEYS.includes(event.code)) {
    userPosition.col--;
  } else if (RIGHT_KEYS.includes(event.code)) {
    userPosition.col++;
  } else {
    return; // Not a movement key
  }

  // Check if move is valid
  if (!isValidUserMove(userPosition.row, userPosition.col)) {
    // Revert to previous position
    userPosition.row = oldRow;
    userPosition.col = oldCol;
    return;
  }

  // Update display and check for win
  showPlayers();
  checkWinCondition();
}
```

### `isValidUserMove(row, col)`

**What it does:** Checks if the player's move is valid.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if the position is within the maze boundaries
2. Checks if the position is a path (not a wall)

**When it's used:** When processing player movement

```javascript
function isValidUserMove(row, col) {
  return (
    row >= 0 &&
    row < MAZE_ROWS && // Within vertical bounds
    col >= 0 &&
    col < MAZE_COLS && // Within horizontal bounds
    maze[row][col] === PATH // Is a path (not a wall)
  );
}
```

### `showPlayers()`

**What it does:** Updates the display to show player and computer positions.

**Step by step:**

1. Clears previous player and computer position visuals
2. Updates the user's position on the display
3. Updates the computer's position on the display

**When it's used:** Whenever the player or computer moves during a race

```javascript
function showPlayers() {
  // Clear previous positions
  clearPlayerVisuals();

  // Show user position (unless at end)
  if (userPosition.row !== END_ROW || userPosition.col !== END_COL) {
    updateCellVisual(userPosition.row, userPosition.col, "user");
  }

  // Show computer position (unless at end)
  if (computerPosition.row !== END_ROW || computerPosition.col !== END_COL) {
    updateCellVisual(computerPosition.row, computerPosition.col, "computer");
  }
}
```

### `checkWinCondition()`

**What it does:** Checks if either player has won the race.

**Step by step:**

1. Checks if the user has reached the end point
2. Checks if the computer has reached the end point
3. If either has won, calls `endRace()` with the winner

**When it's used:** After each player or computer move

```javascript
function checkWinCondition() {
  // Check if user won
  if (userPosition.row === END_ROW && userPosition.col === END_COL) {
    endRace("user");
    return;
  }

  // Check if computer won
  if (computerPosition.row === END_ROW && computerPosition.col === END_COL) {
    endRace("computer");
    return;
  }
}
```

### `endRace(winnerName)`

**What it does:** Ends the race and declares a winner.

**Step by step:**

1. Sets `raceActive` to false
2. Records the winner
3. Stops the computer's movement timer
4. Updates the score based on the winner
5. Updates the status message and button states

**When it's used:** When either the player or computer reaches the end

```javascript
function endRace(winnerName) {
  raceActive = false;
  winner = winnerName;

  // Stop computer movement
  clearInterval(computerMoveInterval);

  // Update score
  if (winner === "user") {
    playerWins++;
    document.getElementById("playerScore").textContent = playerWins;
    updateStatus("🎉 You won! Press 'R' to race again.");
  } else {
    computerWins++;
    document.getElementById("computerScore").textContent = computerWins;
    updateStatus("The computer won! Press 'R' to try again.");
  }

  updateButtonStates();
}
```

### `resetRace()`

**What it does:** Restarts a race from the beginning.

**Step by step:**

1. Stops any ongoing race
2. Calls `startRace()` to begin a new race

**When it's used:** When pressing the 'R' key during or after a race

```javascript
function resetRace() {
  // Stop ongoing race
  if (computerMoveInterval) {
    clearInterval(computerMoveInterval);
  }

  // Start new race
  startRace();
}
```

## Display and Visualization Functions

### `displayMaze()`

**What it does:** Creates the visual representation of the maze.

**Step by step:**

1. Clears any existing maze
2. Creates a grid element with the correct number of rows and columns
3. For each cell in the maze:
   - Creates a div element
   - Assigns appropriate classes (wall, path, start, end)
   - Adds it to the grid
4. Adds the completed grid to the page

**When it's used:** After generating a maze

```javascript
function displayMaze() {
  // Clear existing maze
  mazeContainer.innerHTML = "";

  // Create grid
  const mazeGrid = document.createElement("div");
  mazeGrid.className = "maze-grid";
  mazeGrid.style.gridTemplateColumns = `repeat(${MAZE_COLS}, 1fr)`;
  mazeGrid.style.gridTemplateRows = `repeat(${MAZE_ROWS}, 1fr)`;

  // Create cells
  for (let row = 0; row < MAZE_ROWS; row++) {
    for (let col = 0; col < MAZE_COLS; col++) {
      const cell = document.createElement("div");
      cell.className = "cell";
      cell.id = `cell-${row}-${col}`;

      // Add appropriate class
      if (maze[row][col] === WALL) {
        cell.classList.add("wall");
      } else {
        cell.classList.add("path");
      }

      // Special styling for start and end
      if (row === START_ROW && col === START_COL) {
        cell.classList.add("start");
      } else if (row === END_ROW && col === END_COL) {
        cell.classList.add("end");
      }

      mazeGrid.appendChild(cell);
    }
  }

  mazeContainer.appendChild(mazeGrid);
}
```

### `updateCellVisual(row, col, type)`

**What it does:** Changes the appearance of a cell in the maze.

**Step by step:**

1. Finds the cell element by its ID
2. Removes any existing special classes
3. Adds the new class to change its appearance

**When it's used:** During solving, highlighting the solution, and showing player positions

```javascript
async function updateCellVisual(row, col, type) {
  const cell = document.getElementById(`cell-${row}-${col}`);
  if (!cell) return;

  // Remove existing special classes
  cell.classList.remove("current", "visited", "solution");

  // Add the new class
  cell.classList.add(type);
}
```

### `clearVisualization()`

**What it does:** Removes all visual indicators from the maze.

**Step by step:**

1. Selects all cell elements
2. Removes any special classes from them

**When it's used:** Before solving, clearing the path, or starting a race

```javascript
function clearVisualization() {
  const cells = document.querySelectorAll(".cell");
  cells.forEach((cell) => {
    cell.classList.remove("visited", "current", "solution", "user", "computer");
  });
}
```

### `clearPlayerVisuals()`

**What it does:** Removes player and computer visual indicators.

**Step by step:**

1. Selects all cell elements
2. Removes just the "user" and "computer" classes

**When it's used:** Before updating player positions in race mode

```javascript
function clearPlayerVisuals() {
  const cells = document.querySelectorAll(".cell");
  cells.forEach((cell) => {
    cell.classList.remove("user", "computer");
  });
}
```

## Utility Functions

### `updateStatus(message)`

**What it does:** Updates the status message shown to the user.

**Step by step:**

1. Changes the text content of the status message element

**When it's used:** Throughout the program to provide feedback

```javascript
function updateStatus(message) {
  statusMessage.textContent = message;
}
```

### `updateButtonStates(countingDown = false)`

**What it does:** Enables or disables buttons based on the current state.

**Step by step:**

1. If counting down, disables all buttons
2. Otherwise, sets each button's state based on various conditions:
   - Solve button: disabled if no maze, already solving, already solved, or race active
   - Clear button: disabled if no maze, no solution to clear, or race active
   - Other buttons: disabled based on their relevant conditions

**When it's used:** Whenever the program state changes

```javascript
function updateButtonStates(countingDown = false) {
  // If counting down, disable all buttons
  if (countingDown) {
    solveButton.disabled = true;
    clearButton.disabled = true;
    generateButton.disabled = true;
    resetButton.disabled = true;
    startRaceButton.disabled = true;
    return;
  }

  // Normal button states
  solveButton.disabled = !doesMazeExist || isSolving || isSolved || raceActive;
  clearButton.disabled =
    !doesMazeExist || (!isSolving && !isSolved) || raceActive;
  generateButton.disabled = isSolving || raceActive;
  resetButton.disabled = isSolving || raceActive;
  startRaceButton.disabled = !doesMazeExist || isSolving;
}
```

### `sleep(milliseconds)`

**What it does:** Creates a delay in the program for animations.

**Step by step:**

1. Returns a Promise that resolves after the specified time

**How it works:** JavaScript's Promise and setTimeout are combined to create a function that can be used with async/await to pause execution.

**When it's used:** To create delays for animations

```javascript
function sleep(milliseconds) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, milliseconds));
}
```

## Putting It All Together

The Super Simple Maze Solver demonstrates several important programming patterns:

1. **Backtracking Algorithms** - Used in both maze generation and solving
2. **Asynchronous Programming** - Used for animations with async/await and Promises
3. **Event Handling** - Processing keyboard input and button clicks
4. **DOM Manipulation** - Creating and updating the visual maze
5. **Game State Management** - Tracking the current state and updating UI accordingly

By understanding each function and how they work together, you can build similar interactive applications and games.

### Next Steps

Now that you understand how the Super Simple Maze Solver works, you might want to try:

1. Changing the maze size or animation speed
2. Implementing a different maze generation algorithm
3. Adding a timer to measure how fast you can solve the maze
4. Creating different difficulty levels by adjusting the computer speed
5. Adding sound effects or more visual feedback

Happy coding!
